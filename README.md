# KeTT

KeTT is a simulation of a professional work environment error-tracking tool. I intend to use this tool in my personal projects to record issues and work on them.

## How I Plan to work on this project?

- I got inspiration from [Profy.dev](https://profy.dev/article/react-projects-for-your-portfolio#use-the-readme-file-to-stand-out) React Job Simulator project.

- Heavily used feature branches and Pull Requests.

## Choice for Tech Stack

The project is scaffolded usin `T3 stack` because ift offered an ideal combinations for what I need for a fullstack project.

1. Nextjs is King in fullstack development (personal opinion).
2. Tailwind works well with responsiveness.
3. Nextauth - for advanced functionalities.
4. trpc- I intend to jump on this train later.
